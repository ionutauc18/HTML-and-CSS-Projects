	             <p>The Chihuahua is one of the smallest breeds of dog, and is named after the Mexican state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)" target="blank">Chihuahua</a>.</p>
	             <h3>Their "devilish" behaviour </h3>

		  <p>Here is a quick description from Dogtime.com's website about the lovely Chihuahua dog:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/chihuahua#/slide/1">
		The Chihuahua is a saucy little hot tamale and not just because of his association with a certain fast-food Mexican restaurant.<br>
		He's renowned for being the world's smallest dog, but he may well have the world's biggest personality stashed inside that tiny body.<br>
		That larger-than-life persona makes him appealing to men and women alike.
