Final Assignment - this a portfolio website page that I made to show the skills and projects that I learned during my course. It's a site that I made using HTML and CSS
and that I will update later with Javascript.

Basic_HTML_and_CSS - it's a home page website for a space traveling company. It's been styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers and a form.

One Page Website - it's a home page website for a simple photography company. This project has been styled using CSS and contains a simple navbar, image containers, video
and a form. This is not the final form of this website as I plan to update it and make it look way better.

Bootstrap4_project - this page is an example home page website for a movie theater that have been made using Bootstrap 4. It includes some Bootstrap 4 elements like a navbar, jumbotron,
form,cards and dropdowns.

Tutorial Website - this project is a tutorial website that I made from studying independently on the internet and it's a "my first website" home page. It is made using only 
HTML and it's my first attempt at doing a simple website using google.
