    <h2>I</h2>	
	    <p><span style="font-style: oblique;font-weight: bold">From the five good emperors<br>
I have learned that there were five good emperors,</span><br>
 
From the lemon tree I’ve planted<br>
now I know that leaves unpummeled yet will drop,<br>
 
From the clock, the time, it’s five p.m.,<br>
from the sun the length of day,<br>
 
From Quercus borealis, the queer names of the leaves<br>
of all the trees,<br>
 
From burning I’ve learned burning,<br>
from the aster family chickory abounds,</p><br>

<!--This section is the second verse-->
<section>
    <h2>II</h2>
        <p><span style="font-style: oblique;font-weight: bold">From hawkweed of the colors bright,<br>
from sleeping, of my dreams,</span><br>
 
From mosquitoes, scratching, from fishes, fishing,<br>
from turkeys how to run and how to hop,<br>
 
From erect perennials I’ve learned to reach the shelf,<br>
from my cats to lick the dark part of the tin,<br>
 
From the sparrows I’ve learned this and that,<br>
from Germanic tribes, to gather thoughts in herds,<br>
 
From the window blinds, from the sun decayed,<br>
from the heart, a brimming record braised and turned.</p><br>
